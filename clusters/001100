So this is the end of my conversation.
At this point all of.
I'm her power of attorney.
Which is the 1st day of May.
One of the best we've ever had.
But not a bit problem.
Actually the only thing.
There's no better (unclear).
That's the only thing.
on her part.
The only.
In the entire world.
Oh this is more than one word.
That's my only complaint.
It's just an x-ray for my hip.
No (unclear) very well.
That's my complaint.
It's not today's call.
It's the last month's call.
It's not a real complaint it's just it's the first of the year.
and the young lady that.
Some girls say one thing one time.
Dawny and the last name initial H like hotel.
every always be the feeling.
That's my thought.
So for her a ten times plus.
my everything.
That I'm (unclear) that there is.
More than fine.
That's my complaint.
Or the five star one.
Or one of the others.
Just the kind of.
That's the bottom line.
Neither one is true.
That's my feelings.
at this time I'm sorry.
The lady.
It's not you.
In the past.
So it wasn't your fault.
That's my only complaint.
So that's my primary compliment.
(unclear) so nothing.
But that's not really a complaint.
At the current time nothing.
So anyway that's my only comment.
It's a mess.
With my situation.
Where's the number? Explain all the benefits.
That's the only thing.
It's definitely not Jalissas issue.
The lady (unclear) wonderful.
Always all my problems solved.
It's the best (unclear).
It's not you.
Just a secondary pair of eyes.
Because of my plan.
That's the problem.
The only.
So that's not a problem.
There's really no problems.
As my (unclear) too bad.
But that's the only thing.
My father wasn't covered.
Ain't never (unclear) that thing.
That's not your fault.
That's just my opinion.
A big load off my mind.
That's my answer bye.
So that's my only issue.
A four plus.
The only thing was that it's a prescription.
A little faster time.
They're nothing but a frustration.
The one thing is nothing.
The young lady.
Just a suggestion.
Not had the facts.
No comment at this time.
Her and (unclear).
A lot of things.
It think they're top notch.
That's the only thing.
That's a problem.
That's about all (unclear).
My only bad thing about United is the 75.
One is generic.
The only thing.
Because the (unclear) issue I think.
That's the main thing.
The problem was the system.
This can't be the only time this has happened.
Most recent one anyway.
57 bill on my own.
so about 10 a month.
So that's just my suggestions.
The English wasn't real well.
It's the doctor's fault.
So that is my main complaint about AARP United.
Too many questions.
This the second time I've got denials on this same situation.
In a certain county.
Yeah but the only thing.
That's my only complaint.
My first response the one didn't punch in.
At this time nothing.
A clear yes or no to my question.
That's my only issue.
That's one thing.
That's my final say.
Other than that nothing.
That's my fault.
So that's my only complaint with UHC.
Also my staff's good.
So there's just some uncertainty.
there's a wait.
That's the only thing.
But that's not your fault.
Which is the doctor's fault in my opinion but.
It's a long time ago.
On this call nothing.
At this point absolutely nothing.
First my your system's not working.
there's nothing wrong.
She's one of your best.
No problem at all.
That's all for now.
The very best to you and your business.
And that's the key the what happened here.
It's not you it's me.
In my particular request nothing really.
So it's like not her fault.
All but a very few.
The rest of it.
Is that the end?.
That's what I'd change.
The last 6 months were horrible okay.
But the recording not so much.
And the payments and all.
No beating around the bush.
You're one of the best.
Per this conversation with Jackie nothing.
It's just been-.
She's probably the first one.
For the Volterrian anyway.
That's my fault.
Pound key maybe.
That's been my issue.
No problem at all.
Had no problem today.
That's a big big problem for deaf people.
It's a huge waste of everybody's time.
The gal tried.
To my expectation.
Just the hold time.
So it's not a problem.
But certain wasn't her fault.
It's not your fault.
Given the true facts.
The best it was.
A little faster.
So that's basically my feedback.
Very to the point.
Actually just the waiting.
The previous ones probably it's only about three.
That means an awful lot.
And what my current out of pocket means.
So it's not anybody's fault.
That's the only complaint.
It's very time consuming.
the person that I.
That wasn't the operator's fault.
So that's my only concern with United.
It's no problem for me.
That's all of you.
Since it's an IT issue and stuff.
If I'm not a member.
That's it for my comment.
Not have the survey.
My problems still unsolved.
that's the only thing.
To my estimation nothing right now.
The best telephone call I've had.
The (unclear) today.
Really this time nothing.
That's my reply.
Ten plus for her.
Nothing in my situation.
This is my first time doing this.
These is only the bad things.
There's no way.
That's the one thing.
That's the main thing.
It's not y'all's company.
The 2 before her not so much.
Always to the fullest.
That's the only thing I'm looking for at this time.
No response of any any kind.
And it's just the doctor's office.
But that's the problem.
That's the only bad about that.
No not anything really.
The only thing that I.
That's a lie.
That's the best (unclear).
At this point nothing better.
That's just my person opinion.
All the way around.
That's the only thing.
The lady.
Maybe it's the fault of Medicare.
Possibly maybe the wait time.
But that's not a big issue.
Actually it's two quick things.
That's the only thing.
That's not good enough.
That's what my question was.
But that's not your problem.
No idea at all.
Today's Monday the fourteenth happy Mother's Day for yesterday (unclear).
But any way that's the only thing.
Off hand actually nothing.
Just an A plus.
So just that's the only thing.
Anyway that's my only feedback.
Well there's not a problem.
not only courtesy.
One and zero.
But it's not a big deal.
That's the only thing that happened.
The only.
So that's about the only key I remembered.
There's no way.
That's not your fault.
But that's the only problem and it's not really a problem.
This and that and that and this.
It's just the whole process but everything's fine.
So that this the biggest problem.
What was the question.
And that's the bottom line.
The one thing.
No problem at all.
It's only the 2nd time I've called.
It's the 5 previous calls that (unclear).
So the courtesy the care the cooperation everything.
It's the other party thank you.
I mean the best one.
A plus for a score.
There's another (unclear) she tops.
She's number two the top notch.
That's the only complaint I have about the plan.
Any other question ma'am.
That's my deal.
So that's the only on thing.
In my case absolutely nothing.
No problem at all.
At this point nothing.
Under the circumstances nothing.
That's my answer.
it's not the girl's fault.
The bill's wrong the bill's right.
That's my thing.
Again it's your policy.
One person tells me one thing.
That's my main gripe with this bill or with this notice.
That's my only problem.
That's what happened.
How did your customer.
I'm sure it's just a mistake.
Is that the end of the questionnaire?.
Other than my.
One hundred percent.
That's what it is.
Too much talking.
It's not necessary.
It's one suggestion.
There's no problem at all.
Yes concerning your question.
On this call nothing.
The only suggestion I have.
And it's not her fault.
That is the end of my comment.
The previous calls okay? Forget it.
The first person that.
that's it.
That's not your fault.
Whoever on the line.
That's a problem.
The only thing.
The issue was.
Definitely not her fault.
Just the fault of the system.
It's still in the makings.
So that's my only problem.
So that's my only problem.
So that's the problem I've got.
So that's my little piece.
Just a little bit (unclear).
So it's a little confusing.
That's my only complaint.
My compliments to the department and.
The first question is ridiculous.
That's the only thing.
So anyway that's my only complaint.
And also the office (unclear).
That I'm a month late.
That answer it?.
That's the only thing that was irritating.
This was my first time calling you all.
My experience was a ten all the way.
Some of the language.
That (unclear) distortion in that.
Because the plan stinks.
NO your representative was.
That's the main thing.
It's not the agent.
This is a big problem for me.
At this visit nothing.
15 minutes and that's my only complaint.
Enjoyed the conversation.
My claim wasn't in yet.
Before that even more.
I'm the only that goofed.
Not anything in this conversation.
So it's not your fault.
That's the end of the message.
My only issue is the.
It's 2 months away so.
But anyway that's my answer.
That's what the clock is.
The only.
That's my only issue.
For the future.
my answer was.
The administrative (unclear) are terrible.
The lady that.
It's a mess.
Maybe the billing.
There's really no change.
That's the best part.
That'd be the first start.
This is the third time I'm calling about the same claim.
her so much.
Maybe a section for.
No every very much.
But that's not your fault.
Well the one thing you.
She's an A triple plus to say the least.
Course it's probably only a thousand.
So that's the only other thing.
The best representative I've ever spoken to.
Just a ten minute wait.
XXX is my member's number.
So that's the only reason and that's not a complaint.
At this time nothing.
the guy that.
Like the Japanese songs.
It's just me and my hearing.
That's the only thing.
In this particular case nothing at all.
Just the music.
One thing was.
There's no comments here.
Well it's partly my own fault.
So it's not an easy situation.
That a you know.
Too much paperwork.
Other than English.
Knowledgeable about her job.
That's the blessing.
Also to my last advocate.
That's the only thing wrong.
That really deep voice of hers.
This is coming from your best friend.
That's my comment.
So this matter it is.
That's my problem.
The lady.
never mind.
That's the end.
Most of the time no.
Right now no type of complaint.
Really there's no complaint.
Its not the call but it's the paperwork.
That's the main thing.
Couple of days.
No fault of the agent.
No that's just fine.
But that's a national problem.
It's a shame.
That's my opinion.
That 866 number I'm referring to.
So that's my only beef.
It doesn't matter.
Lot's of time.
My problem was.
That's the first thing.
The third thing is gonna talk.
That's my only comment.
No one's at that location.
That's the only problem we have.
The guy.
would be my only complaint.
Is that the end of the survey?.
That's the only thing so.
At this time nothing.
All the way acrost.
I'm a hard case to crack.
Concern about me.
It's not a problem.
And but that God Jesus is his lord.
It's not the representative problem.
Is that the last question.
That's my issue.
It's none of their fault.
No comment at this time.
For one your.
My complaint (unclear) to hear the (unclear).
(Unclear) is my name.
So a ten across the board for that young lady today.
No problem at all.
That's my only recommendation.
That's my problem right now.
It's not their fault.
But I hope it's the correct one.
It's a blessing.
No improvement on your part.
That's my situation.
(Unclear) to the other person.
That's my only complaint.
Settled all my issues.
Your other agents not so much.
It's not on the list.
In this case nothing.
That's my brief survey.
Paid the whole bill for one thing bye.
If it's a confusing bill.
You said the right things.
So no problem on the agent's fault.
Awesome beyond my expectations.
No comment at this time.
it wasn't his fault.
Especially the fact that my $127.
For the great job you're doing.
That's the best I.
The one thing.
So that's probably the only reason.
One hundred percent.
what is this call.
Or a statement I'm sorry.
There's (unclear) good work.
Satisfied my problem for me.
So not really your problem.
To the point.
And that's the most important thing.
The little gal.
When there's no logical reason.
Did his job well.
One thing that I.
Like the copay's 9 dollars.
It's not working.
That's the only thing.
That's my comment.
That's my complaint.
That's the worst part of the deal.
there's a lot.
It's not their fault.
That's it for that.
any problem at all.
My only criticism otherwise excellent communication.
This point nothing.
That's the only thing.
The (unclear) she was.
So that's my only problem.
(Unclear) this time.
The one thing is that.
A 10 for everything.
That I've missed work.
Especially when it's your error.
It's the doctor that's the problem not your.
So not your fault.
Not all this automatic stuff.
A long wait.
It's not her fault.
That's my problem.
Your (unclear) increase is a real problem.
That's a problem.
The only thing that.
But it's just California's law of.
Just a little bit.
And it's not the representative's fault.
Well the only (unclear).
It's just a confirmation letter.
That's what hurts.
Frustrated senior citizen that's all.
So it wasn't your person's fault.
They're my main problem.
The top the very top.
You were the number 10 all the way.
So that's the only thing.
I think the person.
That is my primary complaint.
No nothing to add.
At the moment nothing.
That's the only thing.
That's my only regret.
Maybe a little more.
what's known.
One thing.
One thing better.
My last advocate which her name is (unclear).
Maybe a faster wait.
It's not a person issue.
The right way.
No problem at all.
Little difficulty there.
The young lady.
Nothing from the kind young lady.
The only thing that I'm a bit.
It's not her.
My (unclear) is great.
It wasn't your error.
So that's the only problem.
So it's really not his fault.
Part of that's me.
That's a bunch of crap.
Not my interaction with this representative.
The only thing that.
Your just fine.
One hundred percent.
As of this conversation nothing.
But it's not your fault.
It's just the way thing work.
Other than that nothing.
That's enough already.
So that is my one complaint.
My problem is solved.
It's just that I.
So that's my only problem.
what would.
In a in a problem I'm having with the (unclear).
That's my problem with your plan.
That's been my only problem.
But again the young lady today.
Actually there's 2 things.
The young woman.
That's the best thing.
Not all the time.
One hundred percent.
But that's not her fault.
No problem with you.
(Unclear) my problem.
At this time not a thing.
At least an hour of a waste of my time.
That's the big thing.
Settled this the.
This kind of a call which was an easy thing.
Above and beyond my expectation.
As a person.
That's my only complaint.
And the agent.
That's my only complaint.
That's my only complaint.
It's the end of the month.
well not your fault.
That's not your fault.
(Unclear) so the lady.
And his resolving of the issue to my satisfaction.
On this call nothing.
that though.
That's my suggestion.
A lot of questions.
That's the problem.
It's such a weight off my shoulders.
It's a pile of horse s***.
That's the reason.
The whole daggone world confusion to me.
And just one of those things.
It's just the system.
That's the only issue.
There were no other issues.
Absolutely not my intention.
It's not you ma'am it's the insurance.
That's the only thing that was left.
A lot of stuff.
The only thing today on the call.
One being unsatisfied.
On this issue nothing.
Forget the chapter it's a book.
Everything on your end.
Nothing but an excellent job bye.
That all otherwise it's supreme.
That's my only concern.
Every single one I've ever spoken to.
It's always the same thing.
So that's my only issue with you.
It's not a major issue.
The lady that.
But the problem wasn't solved.
the last being the longest.
The only complaint and.
The guy.
That's the only thing.
It wasn't your fault.
That's about the only thing because of Well Med.
But that's not her fault.
At this time nothing.
That's the only problem.
